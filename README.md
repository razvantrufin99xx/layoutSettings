# layoutSettings
working with classes and controls and forms and events in Forms



what is this do ing ?
this is just a compiler informing
form is already a pointer or refence so you can use directly Form or Form1 

 public layoutsettings(Form f)
 {
     this.f = (Form1)f;
 }

 this will link a Form1 Form object of class Form type to a class or a class to a Form1 Form
